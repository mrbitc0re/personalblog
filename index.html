      <span class="date">12 Jul 2025</span>
      <p>
        Last weekend I set my alarm for 4 a.m., brewed a tiny mug of coffee, and drove out to the coast.
        Watching the sky turn from deep indigo to soft pink was worth every yawn.
        A friendly ######### even let me sit on his boat for a better view!

      <span class="date">05 Jul 2025</span>
      <p>
        After weeks of feeding a bubbling jar of starter—whom I’ve named “###### ##############”—I finally pulled
        my first loaf from the oven. The crust crackled like a campfire and the kitchen smelled like a bakery
        at dawn. Turns out patience (and a lot of flour) pays off.

      <span class="date">28 Jun 2025</span>
      <p>
        The forecast promised storms, so I ducked into my favorite second-hand ###########.
        Three hours later I emerged with a stack of travel memoirs, a vintage camera manual,
        and a tiny ceramic cat. Rainy-day treasure hunting at its finest.

    <h3 class="post-title">Last Night in the Backyard</h3>
    <span class="date">11 Jul 2025</span>
    <p>
      At around 2:47 a.m., I heard footsteps on the gravel. I looked out the window and saw a man standing completely still under the lemon tree.
      When I turned on the porch light, he vanished. The cameras didn’t catch anything. No sound. No trace.<br><br>

    <h3 class="post-title">The Note on the Bike</h3>
    <span class="date">10 Jul 2025</span>
    <p>
      This morning I found a folded note tucked into the basket of my bike. It simply read: “Keep pedaling.”<br>
      I don’t know who left it, but it made me smile all the way to the bakery.

    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>
      I’m a curious soul who loves early-morning road trips, messy kitchens, and
      collecting stories in unexpected places. This journal is where I keep them safe.
